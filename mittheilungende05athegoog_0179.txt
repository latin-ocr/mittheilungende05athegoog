to them , and they marched along the valley towards Rara
Hissar. The next day the Emperor met the Turkish chiefs in
a confer-enee. The historian tells ol* this conference as a great
triumph for the Emperor and as the glorious conclusion of
the expedition. lt is therefore evident that the Emperor had
reached a place of safety in territory that was still his own.
lf the rock of Kara Hissar were in Turkish hands, his po-
sition would have been very perilous: therefore the fortress
was in his possession, and as soon as he came near it he was
safe. He encamped in front of it, and treated athis ease with
the enemy: this means that the conference was between Sur·
meneh and Kara Hissar. The historian says that it took place
between Augustopolis and Acronios. Comparing this account
with a passage in Theophanes, who tells that in the year 739
Α. D. Seidi Batal Ghazi , the Arab general, was defeated at
AkroniOS‚ and that the remnants of his army ssed to Synnada,
we see that Acronios is Atium Kara Hissar, and that the im·-
pregnable rock was a central point in the border warfare of
that time. Synnada is five hours from Kara Hissar beyond the
bills: an army utterly broken could not flee over the open
plain but sought shelter in the hills till it was reorganised
at Synnada.Again when Constantine Porphyrogenitus describes
the Thema Anatolikon,he makes Acronios a border town bet·
ween Phrygia Pacatiana and Salutaris. Atium Kara Hissar is
not far east of the boundary line.

All these indications lead us to place Acronios at Kara His·
sar and Augustopolis at Surmeneh , and taking them in con-
junction with the independent train of evidence about Me·-
tropolis and its games Augusta, we may regard the proof as
conclusive.

ln the Notit. Episc. 1, Vll, Vlll, IX Acronios is not men-
tioned, but Nicopolis is given: in Notit. lll, X, Xlll Nico·-
polis is not given , but Acronios occurs. This suggests that
the rock ol Armenios, doubtless· often a tower of strength
to the Christians, was also known as Nicopolis. lt begins to'
