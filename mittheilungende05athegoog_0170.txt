Ἦ Θιός, the Goddess, was therefore the chief deity of the an-
cient city in this neighbourhood. On the coins of Lysias the
usual type is a goddess, who appears sometimes as Hecate,
sometimes as Artemi8‚ sometimes as Cybele or Demeter, some·
times as Fortune.

The inscription is so much worn that few letters remained
complete: the surname or epithet Βακκαὸοκωλητὴς is there-
fore rather doubtful. lt is probably an ethnic.

From Lysias the road went south to an old site at ltchki
Kara Hissar‚ generally called by travellers Eski Kara Hissar¹.
The· distance from Nacoleia to Lysias is about XXV miles,
and from Lysias to ltchki Kara Hissar XX miles.

From this point the road towards Synnada went almost due
south down the valley of a little river to Surmeneh‚ an old
site on the edge ol' the Alium Kara Hissar valley, about ΙΧ
miles from each Kara Hissar.

The point where it must have crossed the mountains that
form the southern boundary of the plain is marked out by
nature and still used by the modern road from Afium Kara
Hissar to Cassaba the ancient Synnada. M. Perrot determined
the site of Synnada by an inscription in Cassaba which con-
taius the name of the city. l found another of which there
remained only the conclusion
