138 PRYMNESSOS AM) METROPOLIS

Polybotos which lay at Bulwudun, twenty miles S. E. of Sur·
meneh. Metropolis was a wealthy city throughout the Roman
period, as is proved by its rich coinage. This fact accords
well with the position of Surmeneh in its large and fertile
valley. Metropolis was situated beside the river Astraios (see
a coin in Num. Zst. lV): near Surmeneh flows a river which
drains a considerable district, and for which no ancient name
is known. Athenaeus defines the position of the monument
of Alcibiades by saying that he saw it going from Synnada
to Metropolis1: there was therefore a Roman road between
these two towns and no important city between them, as in
thatjcase Athenaeus would have defined the position of thetomb
still more closely. Synnada is not many miles south of Sur-
meneh , and an important Roman road connects them. Tra-
velling by this road, the emperor Hadrian visited the tomb
and ordered a statue of Alcibiades to be erected on it and an
ox to be sacrifieed annually beside it (Athen. p. 574s). Ptolemy
places a town Melitara (better Melitaia) in this district of
Phrygia, and it has been generally supposed that Melitaia is
Melisse.

The site of Colossai is completely deserted and has been so
for ages: Surmeneh is still a considerable village and has
probably always been a centre of population. Chonai is close
to Colossai and simply took its place 3 but Kara Hissar is nine
miles from Surmeneh, and the remains at the latter place
suggest that it existed through the Byzantine period along-
side of Kara Hissar.

Hierocles (534 A.D.) mentions Metropolis, butno bishopric
of Metropolis is mentioned. On the other hand all the Noti-
tioe Episcopatuum mention a town Augustopolis. ln the Coun-
cils this name appears 553 A. D. 'and later: in the older
council of Seleuceia neither Augustopolis nor Metropolis is

¹ It has sometimes been understood that the southern Metropolis is meant,
but Athenaeus probably refers to a Roman route used in his time, and no
road connected Synnada with the southern Metropolis.
