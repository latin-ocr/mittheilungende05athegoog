ται Παναίνου γραφάς. lt is a fair interpretation² of ἀπαντικρὺ
τῶν θυρῶν to say that it means the face of the wall “opposite
tothe door'' of the temple and if by this expression Pausa*-
nias does not include the whole outer face of the barrier we
can account for, his not mentioning the other parts by the
fact that the side aisles of the temple were closed td visitors
by means of doors' in the front. Further these side aisles were
so narrow that pictures facing them could not have been api·
preciated, if even fairly lighted. We may conclude ther-fori,
that the paintings of Panainos were on the inner face of the
enclosure and were intended m} a measure to continue the
rich effect of the statue itsell'. ·’ .
; Taking the subjects of the pictures in the order ol‘ Pausa·-
nias we find that he begins with‘ ‘Herakles and Atlas-² '—and
ends with‘ ‘Two Hesperides''. So closely were th'ese two
groups associated in the legend that we must imagine them
to have :been placed in the paintings in immediate relation to
each other. shat, no doubt, could be obtained by supposing
him to have begun his description at either of the two front
cerners But in several respects that produces an unsatisfac-
tory result. lt would ignore for example what l 'reg'ard asa

matter of importance, namely, that on each of the three sides
the central group sc'hould consist of two female figures 111 at-
titudes of reposess. 'Again it would not explain 'why Pausa-
nias comin'g to the end of his description says: “ las‘tly
Achilles and Penthesileia'' and then adds “and two Hespe-
rides ''. To meet these difficulties 1 propose the following plan ε

⁴ Michaelis in the metheizunqen ΙΙ p. 3 takes the general usuage of Pitu-
sanias to be for ἀπαντικρὺ jenseits and for πέραν ρεροπῦὸον.

² 11 is strange that Peterscn in his elaborate discussion or the composi·
tion or· these picturas( Kunst cles Phidias p. 359 fol.) and Brunn (Gr. Kanat-
lor 1 p. 172) did not feel how very lame an arrangement it was to have
the three groups ol* placidly occupied female figures placed each at the end

of a side not only without artistic effect as regards the composition, bnt
destructive of it as it seems to me.
