PRYMNESSOS AND METROPOLIS 135 ’

The name of the dedicator is doubtful, but the remarkable
title of Zeus Καρποδότης is quite certain. lt is illustrated by
the coin of PrymneSSOS,published in Mionnel, Suppl.V11p.611:

ΤΠΡΠΡΥ ΚΑΙ, et dans l'eoeerque ΟΤΕΦΑΝ Η. Jupiter ὰ
ηιοίῑίέ nu , assis sur un sidqe ἁ qaucke , tenant dans la main
droite leude deum e'pis et un ραυοι, et dans la gyauclze une
haste ; ἁ ses pieds un aigyle. Ι understand this legend ἄρχον-
τος Κριταρίου τοῦ πρώτου Πρυμνησσίων καὶ στεφανηφόρου. Zeus
was therefore worshipped at Prymnessos as the giver of fruits
and the increase of the earth: the epithet is not elsewhere
applied to him. lt is of similar character to πλουτοδότης Jac-
chos and καρποφόρος Demeter, and suggests that the Zeus ol
Prymnessos ranked among the fertilising and life-giving dei·
ties of the earth and the underworld.

An inscription which Ι copied in front of the mosque at
Seidilar is probably addressed to the same god. lt is also very

rudely and incorrectly engraved on a small round pillar:

The order of the words in this inscription is very unusual:
the common expression is τῶν ἰδίων πάντων σωτηρίας. The
epithet of Ἀρχηγέτης is as unusual for Zeus as καρποδότης.
The coins of the city prove that the chief deities worshipped
in it were Zeus and Cybele under a somewhat unusual form:
