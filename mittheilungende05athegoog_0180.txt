be mentioned about the very time that Colossai was exchan-
gcd for the rock of Chonai ¹.

An inscription on a stone in the doorway of one of the
mosques at Alium Kara Hissar is probably connected with
the gamas of Metropolis, The stone has been painted over, so
that an impression could not he taken: moreover it is in a
bad light. l have seen the stone four tirneS, and all the copies
1 have taken agree in almost every respect. The stone is quite
whole, and hardly more than one letter can he lost at the
ends of the lines. The paint has perhaps concealed some
letters.

l cannot read this inscription, and give with all reserve the
following emendation :—— Ἀγαθὴ τύχη. Ἀθλοφόρων a& πύκτων
ἡιθίων ὁ (πᾶς Ῠ) ξυστὸς Ἔπαξγαθον Ἰκονιέα (ἳ Ἐπαγαθόπεμπτον

¹ Though Sidi Ghazi was killed at Kara Hissar, the Tui-ks long after-
wards built a mosque and show his tomb at the town or Sidi Ghazi‚ sixty
miles to the north. This has led Mordtmann ( Mttnch. Gel. Ans. 1860 „Sidi
Ghazi'') to identify Acronios with Sidi Ghazi‚ but in Notit. X we find Aero-
nios and Sidi Ghazi both mentioned: the latter is an archbishopric‚ and is
therefore not given among the list of hishoprieS, and this seeming omission
misled Mordtmann.
