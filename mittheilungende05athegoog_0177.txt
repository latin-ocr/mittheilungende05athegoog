PRYMNESSOS AND METROPOLlS 139

mentioned but only Augustas. Now the coins of Metropolis
often ,mention the games Anqusta Caesare-ia celebrated at the
town 3 and the conjecture is easy that the town gained a sur-
name from these games , and was during the fifth century
called Metropolis Augusta, and that finally the surname dis-
placed the original name. This conjecture is raised to certainty
hy the account given hy the Princess Anna Comnena of the
Emperor Alexius’s expedition against Iconium (Hist. Lib. XV).
The evidence contained in this account can be appreciated
only by observing the lines of road.

Under the old system the great road of the districtled from
Dorylaion by Nacoleia‚ Lysias, Prymnessos, Docimion, and
Metropolis to Apameia. ln like manner leonium was connec-
ted by a road with Apameia. But when Constantinople became
the head of the country these old roads became unimportant,
and new roads grew to connect the chief cities with the ca-
pital. The road to leonium was one of the most important of
these, and continued to be one of the chief Turkish routes,
till the introduction of steamers revolutionised the road-system.
This road goes by Eski Scheher (Dorylaion), Khan (Lysias),
Beyad, Bulwudun (Polybotos), to llghun (Tyriaion) and Ko-
nieh or leonium. Α branch road to Alium Kara Hissar di-
verges from this main road at Beyad and goes by way of
ltchki Kara Hissar. Alium Kara Hissar is however connected
with Constantinople by a direct road by Kutayah (Cotyaion).
Now as Polybotos lies in the long valley which we described
at the beginning of this paper, it is clear that the traveller
coming from Iconium has a choice of routes at Polybotos. He
may take the direct road over a broken country to Beyad, or
continue along the valley by a longer but easier road past
Kara Hissar.

Alexius marched from Nicaea to Dorylaion and thence to
Santabaris. From this place he sent a detachment against the
Turks in Cedrea. The Turks did not defend the city but re-
treated to Polybotos, and the Byzantine forces without delay·
