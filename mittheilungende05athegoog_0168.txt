{30 PRYMNESSOS ΛΝΒ METROPOLIS

An inscription in honour of Arruntius [P]rimi[genes]‚ erec-
ted probably by the city of Metropolis, thirteen miles south
of PrymnessOS, is published C. 1. G. ΙΙΙ add. 3882d.

Prymnessos was formerly supposed to have lain at Sidi
Ghazi, but Mordtmann ¹ proved conclusively thatNacoleia was
situated there. He was however quite wrong in placing Prym-
nessos at Xapuldak: no city of the Roman period existed at
this place2. The stone on which the above inscription was
placed has evidently been brought from Prymnessos to Afium
Kara Hissar, and it is therefore not probable that the two pla·
ces were very far apart.

From Kara Hissar we rode eastward along the plain nine
miles to Surmeneh. Three miles from Kara H issar the parapet
of a little bridge⁸ is formed by a column of limestone‚ about

eightdfeet long, on which the following inscription is en-
grave τ
