The eponymous magistrate on coins of the Metropolis with·
out the ΦΡΥ added isaerpx-:n-sdqz in this eoin it is the πρῶτος
ἅρχων. One of the coins of Metropolis ΦΡΥ was bought with
a coin of Pisidia. The question must he left to better judges
whether Metropolis ΦΡΥ is the town in the South east of
Phrygia, towards the Pisidian frontier. The fact that it was
afterwards, like Apameia, included in the province of Pisidia
does not affect its original Phrygian character. Α more serious
difficulty is the doubt whether this Metropolis was in the
Roman province of Asia or of Galatia: the town of Apollonia,
not far to the west belonged to Galatia. But even if Metropolis
also was in Galatia, it might still boast itself a Phrygian towb:
Phrygia was not the name οἶ a Roman province. Ptolemy
gives this Metropolis as a town of Phrygia, Apollonia as a
town of Pisidia.

There is a rivergod on some coins of Prymnessos , hut no
name is given. The river on which we have placed this city
is a tributary of the Astraios, which must be the river that
flows from the valley of Sitzhanlu (probably Eucarpia) through
that οἶ Alium Kara Hissar in the lake beside Polybotos, Two
coins now belonging to Mr Lawson ol' Smyrna give two geo·
graphical names that belong to the valley. One of these ap·
plies the name Persis to the mountain often represented on
coins of Docimion, the other has a rivergod on a coin of
Timbrias with the name ΕΥΡΥΜΕ[ΔΩΝῬ]. On the situ-
ation ol* Timbrias, see Hammon, Discov. ll 201.

Abbassus, which occurs in the march of Manlius as fourth
haltingplace from Synnada, is according to Stephanus Μητρό-
πολις τῆς &pu-'fiam but it seems difficolt to suppose that Me-
tropolis Augusta is the place meant, though Livy says that
the Romans could not march more than five miles a day.
