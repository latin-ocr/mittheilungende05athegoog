The barrier of the throne of Zeus
at Olympia.

· One of the interesting facts ascertained by clearing the tem·
ple of Zeus at Olympia has been the position of the barrier
(ἆρῦμκτκ τρόπον τοίχων) which Pausanias V l·l,2 describes as
having prevented a· close approach to the throne. lt is indi-
cated on the· plan given in the Ausqrabunqen ΙΙΙ pl. 31 and
more fully in V pll. 31 -32. But a discussion of the ques-
tions that arise on it appears to be reserved for another oc-
casion. Meantime l would venture to offer one or two ohser-
vations.

· According to my notes made at Olympia and the plansjust
referred to the barrier on each side connects four of the in·-
terior columns of the temple while in the front it runs
across the cella floor leaving apparently a doorway in the mid·
dlej'rhere is no barrier round the back of the statue and
there thus romain for the paintings of Panainos only three
sides of an enclosure. These paintings as described by Pau-
sanias have been admitted generally to fall into nine sepa-
rate subjecte, three for each side and as regards six of them
it is clear ihat they would fit very well into the spaces bet.-
ween 'the columns along the sides. The remaining three is
placed on the front wall of the enclosure would require also
to be separated by some artificial means¹.

-' But.first we must determine ii possible whether the pain-
tings were on the inner or the outer face of the enclosure.
Pausanias says ε τούτων’τῶν ἐρυμάτων ὅσον μὲν ἀπαντικρὺ τῶν
θυρῶν ἐστὶν ἀλήῖλμπῖαι κυκνῷ μόνον, τὰ δὲ λοιπὰ αὐτῶν παρέχε-

 

⁴ I may note here that the nearest approach to a ernest restoration of the
ἐρύματα of Pausanias was so sar as Ι know that of Quatrcmere de Quincy in
the frontispioe of his Jupiter Olympien.
