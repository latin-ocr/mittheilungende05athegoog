carried every year to Afium Kara Hissar. On one of them Ι
copied the following inscription, engraved on a small block
of marble in the shape of an altar, such as are commonly
used either to support a dedicatory offering or to serve as a
tombstone (the βωμὸς of sepulchral inscriptions).

ΧΡΥΕΕΙΙ-ΝΠΑΤΡΙ

There was no roorn on the stone for any words to complete
this halting couplet. Dokimos the founder of the city is fre-
quently mentioned on coins , and is probably identicai with
the general who surrendered Synnada to Lysimachus 302 B.
G. (moysen, Gesch. des Hellen. ΙΙΙ p. 268).

1f ltchki Kara Hissar is Docimion ‚ the city near Seidilar
must be Prymnessos. Ptolemy places these two cities close
together, and the distance agrees well with the milestone
published above. Sir C. Wilson¹ 'copied the following inscrip-
tion at Beyad: it was engraved in very rude letters on a stone
in a fountain:
