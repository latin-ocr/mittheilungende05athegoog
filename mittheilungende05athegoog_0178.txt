ing to seize the spoils in Cedrea pursuod them to Polybotos.
Then Alexius himself advaneed to Cedrea and Polybotos.

ln this account it seems quite certain that Cedrea is a fort-
ress on the direct road, and that it is about one day's march
from Polybotos. Close to the modern town oi Beyad there is
a hill ‚ Assar Kumbet Kale, with a fine fertress of the early
Turkish style. The circuit of the walls is complete; one of
the gates with walls twenty or thirty feet high on each side
is still standing: the style of masonry is so beautiful that at
first 1 did not think it could be Turkish till 1 had seen tho
line Seljuk work in the east of Asia Minor. The fortress which
is now wholly deserted is about two miles west of Beyad:
and the description of the Princess leaves little doubt that it
is Cedrea. The fortress of Assar Kumbet was evidently built
to command the road to leonium. lt is not far east of the sito
where we have placed Prymnessos, bnt is nearer the road to
leonium, which diverges from the older road between Dory-
laion and Apameia somewhere near Khan 1.

ln returning by the same road from leonium, the Emperor
was attacked by an immense force of Turks between Polybo-
tos and the lake near it (Eber Gal). A battle lasted almost
continuonsly for two days , and the Christians were hard pres·
scd but not defeated. They proceeded on their march,and the
Turks continued to harass them. Hitherto as the historian
says they had marehed by the read they had come, but now
they diverged towards a place named Ampous. This place is
unknown, but there were, as we have seen, only two roads
from Polybotos. The Christians had been pressed by the Turks
occupying the hills to the north 3 the read to Cedrea and Do-
rylaion, which led through those hius, was therefore closed

¹ 1 see nothing to tix the site ot Santabaris except that it is on the road
between Dorylaion and Cedrea (Beyad)‚ and that detaehments were sent
from it to Amorium and to Cedrea. This suits any place near Khan or Sidi

Gbazi.
