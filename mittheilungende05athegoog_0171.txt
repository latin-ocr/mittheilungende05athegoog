PRYMNESSOS AND METROPOLIS 133

The road from Kara Hissar goes along the plain bencath
the mountains till it reaches a low neck or pass directly op-
posite Snrmeneh. Here it turns south towards Cassaba, and
it is certain that the ancient road carne straight across the
plain from Surmeneh‚ and crossed the hills by this low pass
to Synnada.

The milestone was formerly on this road in some part of
the valley: it was probably at Surmeneh‚ which was once a
large city and which has been a quarry for the builders of

 

Alium Kara Hissar. tf we go along this road to the north we ’

find ltchki Kara Hissar about nine miles from Surmeneh‚ A
few miles from this village there is another called Seidilar¹:
and the hills here and for miles to the north are full of graveS.
ln some cases an isolated rock is honey-combed with a series
of passages, chambers and stairs. Α number of these rock cut·
tings are Christian,but many are clearly the sepulchres osan
ancient city. ldid not in a very hurried visit see any tombs
with the elaborate ornamentation of the early Phrygian necro-
poleis: they were plain and simple sepulchral chambers, and
a city of the Hellenistic and Roman period must certainly
have existed beside them. We did not find the exact situ-
ation in which this city existed,but its position is determined
by the following considerations ι

1. The rock tombs extend north and northeast from Sei-
dilar for several mileS.

2. Inscribed stones from the city have been carried on the
one side to Atium Kara Hissar, on the other side to Beyad.
Hence though Seidilar is not itself the site of a Roman city,
it must be close to one.

We find then that there were three cities of the Roman pe-
riod in this district, at Surmeneh‚ at Seidilar, and at ltchki
Kara Hissar. The last is determined by the neighbourhood
of the marble quarries to be Docimion. The remains of the
city are still considerable , but a large number of stones are

² Plural of the personal name Seid.
