PRYMNESSOS AND METROPOLIS 131

mes the title Pius in 201 and adds that of Felioe in 213. There
was no trace of the proper beginning of the inscription Imp.
Goes. L. Septimio Severa, which can hardly have failed.

This milestone belonged to the Roman road which traver-
sed the valley. lt is too large and too unsuited for building
purposes to have been carried far. lf then we find the road
and measure thirteen miles in the right direction along it, we
shall be very near Prymnessos·

The modern system of roads is that which grew under the
Byzantine Empire. After Constantinople was made the capital
of the East, a system of roads grew to connect all parts of
Asia Minor with the metropolis3 and that system still conti-
nues. But the milestone belongs to a different system, by which
the produce of the greater part of Phrygia was collected in
Apameia, on the great road leading to Ephesus; from Ephesus
the merchandise was shipped to the markets of tho West. This
older system of roads is preserved to us in the Peutinger Table.
The road which passed near Afium Kara Hissar is thus given
in the Table:

Dorylaion

Docimion

Synnada XXXll

Euphorbium XXXVll

Apameia xxxvl

, This is very incorrect. The line of the road should not becon·

tinued to Dorylaion, but should join at Nacoleia the road
from Dorylaion by Eucarpia to Apameia. A glauce at the map
shows that the road from Dorylaion to Docimion should pass
through Sidi Ghazi (Nacoleia), aud the actual character of the
country confirms this conclusion. From Nacoleia the road
certainly went on to Chosrev Pasha Khan, which is apparently
an ancient site. Kiepert has with great probability placed here
LysiaS, which was an important town with a considerable
coinage.

Among the inscriptions which 1 copied in this village, is
the following:
