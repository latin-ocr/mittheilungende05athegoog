lt may be said to be an unexampled proceeding to place the
figures of the two Hesperides on the door especially when as
yet it has not been positively ascertained that there was a
door. All that is certain is that there is no trace of the bar·
rier in the middle of the floor. lt is difficolt also to see how
a door in the middle could have been avoided. lf there was
in reality such a door the arrangement of the paintings which
1 have just given appears lo one so very appropriate that 1
can see no other possibility than that of placing the Hesperi·
des on it. Pausanias could then natur-aly enough call “Achil-
les and Penthesileia'' the last group‚ and yet add the Hespe-

rides after it.
